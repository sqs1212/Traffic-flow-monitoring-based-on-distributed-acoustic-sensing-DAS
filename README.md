# Traffic Flow Monitoring based on Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS)

Project overview
- This project focuses on traffic flow monitoring using Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). The repository includes code and dataset information related to trajectory detection and vehicle classification.

Dataset (Car_Dataset)
- The dataset is shared via Baidu Netdisk (pan.baidu.com) and contains two subsets: trajectory detection and vehicle classification.
- Shared link (from a Baidu Netdisk Super Member v6):
  - Car_Dataset: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Bk09cqccZ28BfYjqlbQzNg?pwd=LDU1
  - Extraction code: LDU1

Subsets
- trajectory detection: Dataset for trajectory detection (vehicle trajectory/motion detection and localization).
- Classify: Dataset for vehicle classification (vehicle type recognition/classification).

Classify label mapping
- 1 — Sedan
- 2 — Medium truck
- 3 — Bus
- 4 — Large truck
